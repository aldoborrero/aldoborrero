### Hi there 👋

I'm Aldo, a Software Engineer and co-creator of [41North](https://41north.dev), passionate about Business, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org), [Nix](https://nixos.org), and these days with Deep Learning. However, I enjoy playing video games with my new and shiny [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) 🎮, photography 📸, drinking good beer 🍺, and tinkering 💡.

I've been working for the past decade (wow, I'm getting old 😨!) on different companies ranging from small startups to Banks as a consultant.

Initially started as an Android developer that later shifted towards back-end and front-end. In 2016 I discovered by pure chance [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org). Since then, I've been involved in different exciting projects, including an [Open Source block explorer called EthVM V1](https://github.com/EthVM/EthVM/tree/6a956ab8a0912750f5bd83c3a030d7db1f61f992) for [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) and a private [MEV](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/) relay.
